% Benjamin Grant, Rice University McDevitt Lab 09/14/2010
% this function finds the corresponding concentration to a given intensity
% based upon a defined 4 parameter logistic curve. beta are simply the
% parameters defining the curve, conc_min is the minimium concentration
% that this intensity could reasonably correspond to and conc_max is the
